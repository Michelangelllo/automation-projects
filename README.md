# Hi, I’m Ibrahim 👋🏽 
I design how work should flow — then make it run automatically.


I solve operational problems inside growing businesses by diagnosing friction across people, data, and processes — then designing systems that scale.

I’m not focused on tools. I focus on outcomes:
clarity, speed, reliability, and growth leverage.

Automation and AI are simply how I implement well-designed systems.

## The kinds of problems I work on

• Manual workflows that waste hours every week  
• Broken handoffs between teams and tools  
• Lead pipelines that leak opportunities  
• Outreach processes that don’t scale  
• Data scattered across systems  
• Reporting that lacks real-time visibility  

These are system design problems — not software problems.

## How I approach problems

1. Diagnose friction and bottlenecks  
2. Map the system end-to-end  
3. Design scalable flows  
4. Implement with automation + AI where it adds leverage  
5. Measure and continuously improve
